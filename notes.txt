react is basically two important things 

one react virtual dom
two react compionent

first step to install
npx create-react-app my_app

apart from 
app.css
app.js
index.css
index.js

delete everything
remove app.js header section
remove entire index.css index.js
in app.js 17th statement and 5 th import statement 


in between the div elements in the app.js please put hello so in the browser this will be started 
npm start is the command


componenets
what are components 
group of elements 
building blocks

types of components
functional (latest )
class componenets


how to create components
file with code is a componenets :)

nested components component inside componsnet


create a component 

creating nested components
rfce using react extension
arrow function
in the nested components i just rendered a componenet 
and rendered it in main component as welel


the content which need sto be in between div only 

in javascript xml file jsx file html can be written in javscript file
html file ni javascript lo rayadaniki use chesede javascript cml


npm run start is the command :lol

so now its prop time 
props are used to communicate data between componenets
parent is the one which send data and which receives is called child
and its always one way 
second component//child componenet can only read 



rfce is used for function 
rafce is used for arrow function



prop destructuring is simplying large datas and passing them 


useState Hook

In React, useState is needed because it tells React:
“Hey, I changed something — please update the UI!”
